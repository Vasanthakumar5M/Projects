Phishing Website Detection System:
  -> This system effectively detects the given website is phishing website or legitimate website using the machine learning models.
  -> Algorithms used:
        * BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
        * Random Forest

Dataset_creation:
  -> This folder contains the dataset creation programs.
  -> There are three files in it.Using that three files create the dataset.
  -> Every file creates the three different datasets .Merge those datasets.

Note:
  -> For creating the dataset , initial dataset must be provided to the dataset creation programs.
  -> The initial dataset must contains the urls and the flag (1 - for phishing and 0 - for legitimate).
  -> The Phishing urls can be found in PhishTank website and Phishing.Database github repository.
  -> After obtaining the phishing urls create the dataset as soon as possible.Because the dataset creation programs create the datasets based on the request/response of that website.
  -> The legitimate urls con be found in kaggle website.

Models:
  -> Models folder contains the already trained models and the training code.
  -> If the models didn't work properly in the implementation then again train the models using the training code and the datasets.
  -> Use kaggle for training the models efficiently.

Implementation:
  -> This folder contains the actual implementation of the phishing website detection system.
