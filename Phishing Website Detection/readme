Phishing Website Detection System:
  -> This system effectively detects the given website is phishing website or legitimate website using the machine learning models.
  -> Algorithms used:
        * BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
        * Random Forest

Dataset_creation:
  -> This folder contains the dataset creation programs.
  -> There are three files in it.Using that three files create the dataset.
  -> Every file creates the three different datasets .Merge those datasets.

Models:
  -> Models folder contains the already trained models and the training code.
  -> If the models didn't work properly in the implementation then again train the models using the training code and the datasets.
  -> Use kaggle for training the models efficiently.

Implementation:
  -> This folder contains the actual implementation of the phishing website detection system.
